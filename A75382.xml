            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the Twelfth of this inſtant June, 1652. there hapned another great and bloudy Fight within three Leagues of this place, between the Parliaments ſhips, under the immediate conduct and command of Sir George Ayſcue; and the French and Dutch Fleet comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Vice-Admiral Chaſtillon: the manner thus: Sir George Ayſcue having received advertiſements of about 30 Sayl of ſhips, that were coaſting the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118309:3"/>Weſtern channel, reſolved forthwith to weigh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor and make after them: in order whereunto, he hoſted ſayl from Plymouth Bay on the eleventh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and, having a fair gale of wind, about ſix of the clock the next day in the afternoon, made a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of a great Fleet neer Pendennis Peer: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſent forth the Eagle Frigat, to demand what they were, and from whence bound; who anſwer'd, That they were to give an account to none, but the Lord Admiral Vantrump, from whom they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived both their Commiſſion, Power, and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Then they were commanded to ſtrike ſail; but peremptorily refuſed to yield obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſaying, That they were reſolved rather to die, then be guilty of violating the leaſt point of honor: Whereupon Sir George gave them a ſalute with one broad ſide; which was anſwer'd: Then he fitted his ſhip for the ſecond broad ſide, and fired on him, but was again anſwer'd by the Admiral, who bore up his Helm, and ſtood before the wind: whereupon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Parliaments ſhips coming up to him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with two broad ſides, &amp; laid him aboard the ſtar-board; which the enemy perceiving, blew up the Upper-Decks; ſo that the Engliſh were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to deſert her, with ſome loſs: But upon Sir Georges tacking about the third time, he preſented
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118309:3"/>them with a Volley of threeſcore Guns, which did great execution, both above Decks, and between wind and water; for ſoon after ſhe ſunk, and about one hundred men were drowned.</p>
            <p>The ſight whereof cauſed great aſtoniſhment to the French and Dutch; who, by reaſon of the neer approach of the night, declined engagement; till the next morning about five of the clock, where an exceeding ſharp diſpute happened, and continued for the ſpace of ſeven hours, which was performed with great gallantry on both ſides; till at laſt, after many hundreds of ſhot, it pleaſed the Divine Power of Heaven to crown the Engliſh with Victory, and to vanquiſh their Enemies: for, of theſe thirty ſayl, not ſeven got off from being exceedingly rent and torn; five were taken, and three ſunk; but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome loſs: there being five (at preſent) miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. The Enemy was at leaſt three to one; yet ſo gallant a Reſolution do the Engliſh retain, that they dare attempt to fight upon any diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>We hear that Captain Bradſhaw (the great Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat) doth much annoy the Engliſh upon the Iriſh Seas, and that he hath lately taken four or five Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and chaſed ſome others into Port-Patrick. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Pyrates there are, who do exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thoſe parts.</p>

            <p>From the Downs we have received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, That the Hollander is very buſie upon the North Seas, in catching of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; and Van-Trump hath ſent a great Fleet to them to ſecure and convoy them: Whereupon, General Blake having notice thereof, immediatly gave inſtructions to Major Bourn, to haſten after with fifty ſail, ſo that if they meet, a great engagement is expected.</p>
            <p>Great are the preparation of both States for the defence of both Nations, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the preſent Treaty between the Parliament and the Lord Embaſſadors; &amp; divers ſhips (by expreſs command from the Councel) are ordered to expedite out of the River to the Downs, and thoſe that want proviſions, and other neceſſaries, are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to be ſupplied from other ſhipping. Yet notwithſtanding, a happy Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is much deſired, and a firm peace and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118309:4"/>ſetled: For effecting whereof, the ſum of one hundred thouſand pounds are prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Parliament of England by the States of Holland, in reference to their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, Freedom, and Fiſhing. But 'tis gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, that the Parliament demands for future ſecurity, the rendition of Brill, fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and certain other Gariſon Towns, for the placing in of Engliſh Gariſons, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of future differences.</p>
            <p>We hear that upon ſome further action between the Engliſh and the Hollander, that Captain Taylors ſhip is ſunk, together with the great James; the truth whereof, I dare not affirm, conjecturing it to be onely a Rumor: Many of the Dutch-men are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly inclining to peace and unity; but on the contrary part, others there are, who thirſt after bloud: but whether ſuch as may or ſhall foment this diviſion, do not act the policy of the Wolf in the fable, that perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118309:5"/>the ſheep to give over their Maſtives? Or, if Venice may not unproperly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſignet on Neptunes right hand: and whether England and the Netherlands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtraight Confederacy, may not be ſtiled his two arms. Again, whether your Maiden-Towns, as you call them, may not long enjoy that Title under the allyance of England, who hath many as rich and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Harbors, as of France, that cannot juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brag of the like plenty, or conveniency for ſcituation? But for this, as all good things elſe, let glory, honour, and praiſe be given to God.</p>
            <p>The Report concerning the James being ſunk, is fabulous: And the Tyger (commanded by Captain Peacock) being for ſome time miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, is with ſafety come up to the Fleet; and hath brought in three Dutch Prizes.</p>
